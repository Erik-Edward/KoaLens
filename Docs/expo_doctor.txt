✖ Check dependencies for packages that should not be installed directly
The package  "@types/react-native" should not be installed directly in your project, as types are included with the "react-native" package.

✖ Validate packages against React Native Directory package metadata
  The following issues were found when validating your dependencies against React Native Directory:
  Unsupported on New Architecture: react-native-image-crop-picker
No metadata available: @anthropic-ai/sdk, @tanstack/query-async-storage-persister, @tanstack/react-query-persist-client, sentry-expo, uuid
Advice: 
  - Use libraries that are actively maintained and support the New Architecture. Find alternative libraries with https://reactnative.directory.
  - Add packages to expo.doctor.reactNativeDirectoryCheck.exclude in package.json to selectively skip validations, if the warning is not relevant.
  - Update React Native Directory to include metadata for unknown packages. Alternatively, set expo.doctor.reactNativeDirectoryCheck.listUnknownPackages in package.json to false to skip warnings about packages with no metadata, if the warning is not relevant.
